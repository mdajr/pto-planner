# PTO Planner

Note: This project was generated collaboratively using Google Gemini and OpenAI ChatGPT.

PTO Planner is a lightweight, client‑side web tool to plan future paid time off. It simulates monthly accruals, caps, and year‑end rollover, and lets you add named vacations over arbitrary date ranges. The timeline shows how your balances evolve over time and flags any periods where balances would go negative.
